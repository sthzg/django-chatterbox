**Work in early development**

``django-chatterbox`` is like that one person you know that no matter what 
you're telling them will notify each and everyone about it. Well, kind of.


### Django and Python support

Out of a project's necessity the development starts with supporting 
Django 1.6 and Python 2.7 and will afterwards increase to support Python 3 
and the latest stable Django release (currently 1.8).
